# Keeper App Midterm Project

This is my midterm project for COMS3102 Fullstack Web Development.  

I implemented the project as described in the assignment's google doc. This included creating the necessary components and implementing the ability to add and delete notes.  

## Sources
I used https://www.tutorialspoint.com/search-by-id-and-remove-object-from-json-array-in-javascript to help determine how to find and remove a specific key from a JavaScript array of JSON elements.  

I also looked up basic tutorials (ie. W3Schools) and on forum sites (ie. StackOverflow) when there was something I did not yet know how to do in React, HTML, or CSS that was necessary for the project.
